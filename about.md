Hi, Iâ€™m **Maria Granados** â€” a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and deploying data and AI/ML systems that are production-ready, scalable, and aligned with strategic business outcomes.

Currently based in Australia, Iâ€™ve worked across banking, consulting, and enterprise tech to deliver full-stack solutions in data science, machine learning, GenAI, and MLOps. My work spans everything from churn prediction, NLP classification to LLM prototypes and ML infrastructure uplift â€” with a strong focus on **deployability, automation, and impact**.

I started in **data and platform engineering**, progressed into **applied machine learning**, and now specialise in **building AI systems** that integrate advanced analytics, model experimentation, and reproducible pipelines with real-world decision-making.

Known for blending **technical depth** with **consulting fluency**, I bridge the gap between engineering, data science, and business strategy â€” helping organisations unlock value through well-designed, explainable, and scalable ML systems.

Iâ€™m currently completing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science while exploring opportunities in **ML engineering, GenAI systems, and AI infrastructure** â€” where I can lead delivery, build impactful tools, and continue deepening my specialisation across applied AI.

When Iâ€™m not building, I explore the narrative structures that shape us, studying cultural systems through history, literature, philosophy, and fashion. Iâ€™m fascinated by the patterns that connect us as humans, and by the way imagination gives rise to new worlds once only dreamed.

I bring that same curiosity and systems thinking into how I build, design, and deploy AI. To me, AI shouldnâ€™t just serve efficiency â€” it should expand our capacity to dream, to create, and to shape futures beyond what we once believed possible.
