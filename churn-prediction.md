### 📌 Project Summary

**Role:** Lead Data Scientist and ML Engineer  
**Organisation:** P&N Bank  

Designed and delivered the bank’s first internal machine learning system to predict and reduce customer churn across Home Loans and Term Deposits. The project established a scalable ML foundation, integrated with key business processes, and supported strategic decision-making for proactive retention.

---

### 🎯 Objective

Shifted the bank's churn management approach from reactive reporting to a proactive, model-driven system for identifying and targeting at-risk customers early in the lifecycle.

### 🛠️ Scope and Responsibilities

#### 🔹 Problem Framing and Strategic Alignment
- Collaborated with product, retail, and data stakeholders to scope the use case and define measurable success metrics.
- Reframed the business problem to align with retention priorities and move beyond retrospective churn tracking.

#### 🔹 Feature Engineering and Domain Collaboration
- Mapped customer journeys and extracted churn signals from behavioral, transactional, and engagement data.
- Engineered features aligned to lifecycle stages and time windows (e.g., recent vs. long-term trends) to surface early signs of disengagement.

#### 🔹 Model Development and Experimentation
- Conducted EDA and addressed class imbalance in the churn target.
- Selected business-aligned metrics (F1, PR-AUC) for evaluation.
- Applied Design of Experiments to compare model types and feature groups, balancing performance and interpretability.
- Improved model performance by 30% through iterative tuning and feature refinement.

#### 🔹 MLOps and Pipeline Design
- Built modular ML pipelines with Python, Snowflake, and produced interactive visuals in Power BI.
- Integrated CI/CD for reproducibility and scalability.
- Leveraged Snowflake model registry for versioning and automated scoring.

#### 🔹 Stakeholder Tools and Enablement
- Delivered interactive Streamlit apps to expose churn insights to business users.
- Reduced analyst load by enabling direct access to model predictions and drivers.
- Produced documentation and reusable code templates to support team enablement.

#### 🔹 Operational Integration and Governance
- Worked with Product and Salesforce teams to explore CRM workflow integration.
- Facilitated discussions around model governance, oversight, and data quality as part of broader enablement strategy.
