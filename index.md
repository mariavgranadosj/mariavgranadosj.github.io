    <h2>üôã About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Maria Granados</strong> ‚Äî a Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and deploying data and AI/ML systems that are production-ready, scalable, and aligned with strategic business outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôve worked across banking, consulting, and enterprise tech to deliver full-stack solutions in data science, GenAI, and MLOps. My work includes churn models, NLP classifiers, LLM prototypes and ML infra uplift ‚Äî with a strong focus on <strong>deployability, automation, and impact</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started in data and platform engineering, progressed into applied ML, and now specialise in building AI systems that integrate experimentation, reproducibility, and strategic delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for blending <strong>technical depth</strong> with <strong>consulting fluency</strong>, I help organisations unlock value through explainable, scalable ML.

    <h2>üé® Humanity + AI</h2>
    <p>
      When I‚Äôm not building, I explore the narrative structures that shape us ‚Äî studying cultural systems through history, literature, philosophy, and fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm fascinated by the patterns that connect us as humans, and how we use imagination to create. I bring that same curiosity and systems thinking into how I design and deploy AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, AI shouldn‚Äôt just serve efficiency ‚Äî it should expand our capacity to dream, to create, and to shape futures beyond what we once believed possible.
