Welcome! Iâ€™m a **Senior Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer** with 6+ years of experience designing and delivering production-grade systems across data, machine learning, and AI that drive real business value.

I specialise in building scalable, reproducible ML pipelines, GenAI tools, and full-stack data systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans banking, consulting, and tech â€” Iâ€™m passionate about bridging business needs with practical technical delivery.

This portfolio highlights some of the systems Iâ€™ve built or led. 

Looking for someone who can think strategically, build intelligently, and communicate clearly? Youâ€™re in the right place.
