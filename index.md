  <h2>üôã About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Maria Granados</strong> ‚Äî a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and deploying data and AI/ML systems that are production-ready, scalable, and aligned with strategic business outcomes.</p>
  <p>Currently based in Australia, I‚Äôve worked across banking, consulting, and enterprise tech to deliver full-stack solutions in data science, machine learning, GenAI, and MLOps. My work spans everything from churn prediction, NLP classification to LLM prototypes and ML infrastructure uplift ‚Äî with a strong focus on <strong>deployability, automation, and impact</strong>.</p>
  <p>I started in <strong>data and platform engineering</strong>, progressed into <strong>applied machine learning</strong>, and now specialise in <strong>building AI systems</strong> that integrate advanced analytics, model experimentation, and reproducible pipelines with real-world decision-making.</p>
  <p>Known for blending <strong>technical depth</strong> with <strong>consulting fluency</strong>, I bridge the gap between engineering, data science, and business strategy ‚Äî helping organisations unlock value through well-designed, explainable, and scalable ML systems.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm currently completing my Master‚Äôs in Data Science while exploring opportunities in <strong>ML engineering, GenAI systems, and AI infrastructure</strong> ‚Äî where I can lead delivery, build impactful tools, and continue deepening my specialisation across applied AI.</p>

  <h2>üé® Humanity + AI</h2>
  <p>When I‚Äôm not building, I explore the narrative structures that shape us ‚Äî studying cultural systems through history, literature, philosophy, and fashion.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm fascinated by the patterns that connect us as humans, and by the way we can use our imagination to create. I bring that same curiosity and systems thinking into how I build, design, and deploy AI.</p>
  <p>To me, AI shouldn‚Äôt just serve efficiency ‚Äî it should expand our capacity to dream, to create, and to shape futures beyond what we once believed possible.</p>
