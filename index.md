      Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Maria Granados</strong> ‚Äî a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and deploying production-grade data and AI/ML systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based in Australia, I‚Äôve delivered full-stack solutions across banking, consulting, and enterprise tech ‚Äî spanning churn prediction, NLP classification, LLM prototypes, and MLOps uplift. My work focuses on deployability, automation, and measurable impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started in data and platform engineering, progressed into applied ML, and now specialise in building AI systems that combine analytics, experimentation, and real-world decision-making. I bridge the gap between engineering, data science, and strategy ‚Äî with a strong focus on explainability and scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm currently completing a Master‚Äôs in Data Science and exploring senior opportunities in ML engineering, GenAI systems, and AI infrastructure.

    <p class="lead text-center">
      When I‚Äôm not building, I explore the narrative structures that shape us ‚Äî studying cultural systems through history, literature, philosophy, and fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm fascinated by the patterns that connect us as humans, and by the way imagination gives rise to new worlds once only dreamed. I bring that same curiosity and systems thinking into how I build, design, and deploy AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, AI shouldn‚Äôt just serve efficiency ‚Äî it should expand our capacity to dream, to create, and to shape futures beyond what we once believed possible.
