<!-- HUMANITY + AI Intro -->

  <div class="inner-card">
    <h2>🎨 Humanity + AI</h2>
    <p>I design AI systems that serve people first — blending technical precision with empathy, accessibility, and long-term impact. My work spans ML infrastructure, GenAI prototyping, and scalable deployment, always grounded in the belief that technology should enhance human decision-making, not replace it.</p>
    <p>I’m fascinated by the patterns that connect us as humans, and by how our imagination shapes our creations. I bring that same curiosity and systems thinking to how I build, design, and deploy AI.</p>
    <p>To me, AI shouldn’t just serve efficiency — it should expand our capacity to dream, to create, and to shape futures beyond what we once believed possible.</p>

<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<section id="about-me" class="card-section light-bg">
  <div class="inner-card">
    <h2>🙋 About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Maria Granados</strong> — a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and deploying data and AI/ML systems that are production-ready, scalable, and aligned with strategic business outcomes.</p>
    <p>Currently based in Australia, I’ve worked across banking, consulting, and enterprise tech to deliver full-stack solutions in data science, machine learning, GenAI, and MLOps. My work spans everything from churn prediction, NLP classification to LLM prototypes and ML infrastructure uplift — with a strong focus on <strong>deployability, automation, and business impact</strong>.</p>
    <p>I started in <strong>data and platform engineering</strong>, progressed into <strong>applied machine learning</strong>, and now specialise in <strong>building AI systems</strong> that integrate advanced analytics, model experimentation, and reproducible pipelines with real-world decision-making.</p>
    <p>Known for blending <strong>technical depth</strong> with <strong>consulting fluency</strong>, I bridge the gap between engineering, data science, and business strategy — helping organisations unlock value through well-designed, explainable, and scalable ML systems.</p>
    <p>I’m currently completing my Master’s in Data Science while exploring opportunities in <strong>ML engineering, GenAI systems, and AI infrastructure</strong> — where I can lead delivery, build impactful tools, and continue deepening my specialisation across applied AI.</p>
    <p>When I’m not building, I explore the narrative structures that shape us — studying cultural systems through history, literature, philosophy, and fashion. I draw inspiration from the gothic depth of classic novels, the sweeping arcs of opera, and the intricate worlds of science fiction — bringing that same sense of storytelling, aesthetics, and systems thinking into the AI I design and the way I communicate ideas. At the heart of my work is a search for the threads that connect us across cultures.</p>
