Welcome! I’m a **Senior Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer** with 6+ years of experience designing and delivering production-grade systems across data, machine learning, and AI that drive real business value.

I specialise in building scalable, reproducible ML pipelines, GenAI tools, and full-stack data systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans banking, consulting, and tech — I’m passionate about bridging business needs with practical technical delivery.

This portfolio highlights some of the systems I’ve built or led. 

Looking for someone who can think strategically, build intelligently, and communicate clearly? You’re in the right place.
